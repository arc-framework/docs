# Getting Started

Get from zero to a running A.R.C. platform in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Docker Desktop** | v20.10+ | Latest |
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 8 cores |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 16 GB |
| **Storage** | 10 GB free | 50 GB free |

**Install Docker Desktop:**
- [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)

## The A.R.C. Journey

Setting up A.R.C. is a three-step process:

1. **[Install the CLI](./installation.md)** — Download the `arc` binary for your platform
2. **[Run the Quickstart](./quickstart.md)** — Initialize and launch your first workspace
3. **[Configure Your Platform](./configuration.md)** — Customize features, tiers, and environment

Each step builds on the previous one. Start with installation and you'll have a running platform within minutes.

**Already have the CLI installed?** Jump straight to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md).
