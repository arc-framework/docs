  A.R.C. Documentation
</h1>

This repository contains the source code for the official A.R.C. (Agentic Reasoning Core) documentation website.

The site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Development

First, make sure you have your dependencies installed.

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, to start a local development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

A.R.C. is a Docusaurus project, which is based on React. You know, the JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Just in case you forgot.
